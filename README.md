# HDM_Python

In order to run, add the data prepared by Rob. The data directory should be inside HDM_Python, and needs to be named "platyrrhine".
The platyrrhine folder should contain:

- Names.mat
- FinalDist.mat
- softMapMatrix.mat
- ReparametrizedOFF with the .off files inside.

By running HDM.py from within the src folder, you should get the pringle below.
