# HDM_Python


# TODOS:
- convert mappings into one matrix readable by scipy
- Load data samples with trimesh.



# Notes:
- input files, what formats should they be in? i.e. data_samples and maps
We just assume they are numpy arrays. We maybe provide tool for converting ply files into the numpy array.
- should input files also be able to be provided as a np.array or is it fine to assume path
- the paths, is there a specific way this should be done? like relative paths.
